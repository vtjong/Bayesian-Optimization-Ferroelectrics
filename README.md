# Basics
Gaussian process functionality provided by `gpytorch`, bayesian optimization framework provided by `botorch`.  Acqusition functions were written to fit with the `botorch` API.  

# Preprocessing
To run the data preprocessing script, simply change `dir = '/Users/valenetjong/Bayesian-Optimization-Ferroelectrics/data/KHM010_'` in `src/preprocess.py` to reflect your local repo and run. The processed data will be saved to a subdirectory processed in the data folder. 

# Training
To run the Gaussian Process training script, navigate to `src/main.py.` You will need the `wandb` module, which can be installed via pip. Refer to https://docs.wandb.ai/quickstart for info on start-up and https://docs.wandb.ai/guides/sweeps/quickstart for how to conduct a sweep.
